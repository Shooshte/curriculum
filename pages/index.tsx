        Iâ€™m shooshte and I am believe that everybody deserves freedom, and a
        low-pressure environment to unlock their creativity. My blog posts
        include a wide range of topics, but in the end, they all focus on
        skills, experiences and lessons learned that helped me achieve the same.

      <p className="text">
        Since I work as a coder, a lot of the content I produce focuses on
        software development, but I really believe the content can be applied to
        a wider range of topics and professions.
