There is a very big discrepancy between the salaries offered in mid-level and senior level software developer roles. Even though the job ads look for employees that know the same technology and would work on completing equally complicated tasks, the yearly wage difference can be more than $100,000! Part of this can be attributed to the job market going global. Nowadays, everyone can apply for remote jobs and work for companies in countries with the richest economies. It will take some more time for the job market to adjust accordingly and hopefully level itself out. Nevertheless, one of the principal reasons for this discrepancy is the possession of additional non-technical skills that make certain senior developers worth a lot more than others.

While there are a lot of resources online focusing on how to get really (and I mean REALLY) good at writing code, there seems to be a lack of reading material focusing on these additional skills. This post can be seen as a starting point - a way of assessing where you currently stand - and acts as a foundation on which to base your googling.

## Producing consistent results

Over-promising and under-delivering is a constant in software development. Coding is a creative process, and as in a lot of other creative fields, the performance of coders will vary from time to time. There are good days where everything just aligns perfectly and you can fly through your to-do list; and then there are days when even the easiest task takes a lot longer than it should. Adjusting deadlines according to this performance variance, as well as focusing on always ensuring the same quality of results, will instantly make you more valuable! Managers value consistency over anything else. Being able to rely on getting results saves a lot of headaches since being able to plan ahead and commit to a plan is key to running most successful businesses. To sum up, learn how to maintain the same level of quality and performance in all of the tasks that are asked of you.

If you want to become more consistent in your work, here are a couple of things to consider that helped me improve significantly:

### Double your estimated time

At first, this sounds like a cynical joke, but it is the best thing you can do for your consistency, your mental health, and in effect, your colleagues! Having the extra time will save you when minor unforeseen adjustments need to be made. If everything goes according to plan, having the extra time to refactor, clean the code and write tests will ensure greater quality when it comes to your work. If you have extra time after you are done, use it to improve your skills, help your teammates or reduce technical debt you have in your codebase (there is always technical debt in any codebase). And if you really have nothing else to do for the remainder of the day, then you can let your manager know that you finished the task early.

### Write automated tests for the code you are working on.

This one is so simple that I still cannot believe it took me more than 6 years to finally start doing it. If you are writing new code, write an end-to-end (integration) test that covers the functionality you are required to add. If you are modifying existing code, write an end-to-end test that covers the functionality already in the system before making changes to the code. Afterwards, add end-to-end tests for the functionality you are adding. This will ensure that you do not create any retention bugs and that the software you produce works as intended. It also has the added benefit of catching mistakes in the system that are not caused by your code. Fewer mistakes while manually testing means more consistency in the long run.

### Stick to the plan

Clearly define the scope of the changes that you are making, and hold on to them for dear life. Focus on one thing at a time and do that one thing well. It is easy (trust me, I know) to get distracted and end up making “minor” improvements to the software while working on your task. While these may seem innocent, they take up a lot of your time and energy, and add more complexities that you need to test. Introducing potential points of failure is never a good thing when you are trying to be consistent, and changing the scope of what you are working on in the middle of implementation will also change the timeline.

### Work with the people around you

Work with your colleagues whenever possible. Pair-programming, code reviews and whiteboard planning are all very good ways to level out the good and the bad days. To put it simply, if I have one very good day per week, three average ones, and one bad one, I will benefit significantly from working with someone who is having a good day while I’m experiencing my bad one. Additionally, this is a great way to cover your weaknesses and use the strengths that are specific to you. While not everyone will have time to work with you, make this a part of your working process and do it as often as possible. When you feel like you are stuck or that no good ideas are popping up, it should feel natural to go to your colleagues and ask for their opinion. Even talking things over for just a couple of minutes might be the difference between working on a mediocre idea that reduces the quality of your work, or establishing a great one!

## Building a team, and working in one

![Different hands fist bumping over a work table](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583321500900-82807e458f3c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1170&q=80)

There is something inherently cool and romantic about the image of a lone coder creating something wonderful that everyone admires alone in the middle of the night. While there are some cases of this (Vampire Survivors being the latest), exceptional software is most commonly written by high-performing teams in which a lot of brilliant people work together. Learning how to work in a team and building a team with your colleagues is essential to being successful.

These are the things that are commonly missing, leading to a dysfunctional team: trust inside the team, a common goal, and a healthy debate before major decisions. Getting these right makes solving all other problems a lot easier. If you learn how to be a good teammate and contribute a lot to building a team, you will be worth a lot more to your manager. Saving them the headache of having to manage the relationship between you and your teammates is a sure fire way to improve your worth, especially in a field where good people skills are hard to find.

### Building trust

Talk openly about your weaknesses and strengths. Working in a team requires trust, and the best way to establish this is by talking openly about the things you might be lacking. When you ask people for help - either with doing specific tasks or as a way of improving your skills - they will trust you more. Discussing the things you are good at, meanwhile, will enable people to ask you for help with your area of expertise. A combination of being vulnerable and also enabling others is very good for building trust within a team.

Furthermore, aim to talk transparently about your mistakes. Nothing breaks trust more than sweeping your mistakes under the rug and pretending they never happened. Put your mistakes in the limelight so that you and the whole team can benefit by learning from them! This will also show your teammates that you do not have a hidden agenda or a personal goal, but rather that you made an honest mistake and want to fix the situation, improve your work, and avoid repeating the same error in future.

### Establishing common goals

Establishing a common goal is very important so as to be able to resolve conflict and tension within the team. When what the team wants to achieve is agreed upon and clear, people are much more receptive to constructive feedback, show more focus, and don’t engage as much in company politics. This establishes a clear reference for when decisions need to be made - you can always evaluate whether a decision will bring the team closer to one of the goals.

Having a clear goal that everyone is working towards is also a great motivator for you and your teammates. It will enable everyone to work independently, be more creative, and take ownership of big decisions. This results in more satisfaction and productivity amongst employees. Context matters a lot! Imagine a difference between a factory worker producing ammunition without knowing what it will be used for and a factory worker producing ammunition that will be used to fight an invading nation. Being able to envision a goal clearly also brings the benefit of pushing everyone through the tasks that are not pleasant or exciting.

### Show your teammates that you value their opinion

Let everyone speak their minds before a decision is made, even if you believe (or know) they are wrong. Wanting to achieve a consensus on decisions is highly overrated. We often fall into the trap of trying to convince everyone to agree with us so much that we do not let them state their opinion. In reality, people are usually okay with the decision to not do things their way, so long as they get to express their opinion or argue for it. So let everyone that wants to make their points speak and then decide on a plan of action. After that, make sure that everyone inside the team knows what the next course of action is, and how it will help to achieve the team's goal. Create the space for your teammates to speak, and listen carefully to what they have to say. Even if you do not agree with them in the end, showing your teammates that you value their opinion is very beneficial, and will bring you closer together!

## Sharing Knowledge

Teaching what you know is a great way to empower people around you. When you are explaining what you know to somebody else, you are forced to fill up the holes in your own knowledge. It is a great way to gain trust and positive or constructive feedback from your coworkers. When you are able to raise the performance of your teammates, you are adding a lot more than just your coding output to the team, making you very valuable! While knowledge sharing is a complex topic, I find doing these simple things is a great way of getting the communication started:

- Pair programming
- Code reviews
- A scheduled weekly 15-30 min codebase state review
- Development of sprint retrospectives
- “Water cooler” conversations

Find a way to actively engage with your coworkers when you do this, and set some clear motivation as to why they should discuss a certain topic with you. Being able to work faster or solving a specific problem they recently encountered are good examples of that. Don’t just link a tweet, a blog post, or a book title and expect people to do the rest on their own. Even if they follow up on the reading material you provide, this will not point back to you. Instead you want your manager to hear “I learn a lot from him” when they ask your peers for an opinion.

## Git gud

All of the above will help you when negotiating your salary as they will increase your value a lot compared to other candidates that only know how to code. That being said, you still need to know how to code, and know how to do it well. This post is about supporting skills, and none of these matter if the code you are writing is structured poorly, does not work, or pisses off your colleagues. Git gud, and good luck on your journey!
