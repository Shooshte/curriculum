# This is a text blog post

## Introduction

### The why?

I am writing this blog post in order to test how gray-matter parses mardown. I want to see what happens when:

- I use blockquotes
- I use unordered lists
- I use ordered lists
- I use a single line of code
- I use code blocks
- I use horizontal rules
- I use external links
- I use _semi-bold text_
- I use **bold text**
- I use **double underscores**
- I link images

`const singleLine = 'Single line of code'`

```javascript
// This is a comment about my code
const Foo = "bar";
const RandomFunction = () => {
  // That renturns something
  return Foo;
};
```

Just [google it](http://google.com/)!

1. Test blog post
2. Full of weird .md syntax
3. See how it's parsed
4. See how it's rendered in the browser
